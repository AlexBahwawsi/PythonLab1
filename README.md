Recapping Data Types, Operators, While Loops

## The while loop
while loops allow programmers to repeat a task as a long as a certain condition stays true.  

### Repeat 'n' times
```
exp = 6
total = 1
base = 4

while exp > 0: 
  total = total * base
  exp--

print("total is:", total)
  
```

### Repeat until something happens
```
keep_counting = "y'
count = 0

while keep_counting = "y":
  count+=1
  print("count is: ", count)
  keep_counting = input("Do you want count another? (y/n)": )
  
print("the end count is: ", count)
  
```

## Random python package
The python standard library has 


# Dice 

## Create a program that rolls a normal dice (6 sides)
The program then should be extended to roll any number, with the input being provided by the user.  


## Create a new dice that prompts the user for how many sides on their dice.  
The program should then roll
